  detail: "\tThe leader of the RABBIT Squad at the SRT Academy. Her call sign is
    \"RABBIT 1.\"\r\n\r\n\tMiyako originally registered for the SRT Academy because
    of her deep admiration for its adherence to justice. When they suddenly closed
    down the academy, she was left homeless and camping out in a park with other
    RABBIT Squad members. She is to-the-point and rarely shows what she's thinking
    so can come off as uncaring, but has the kindest heart in the squad."
