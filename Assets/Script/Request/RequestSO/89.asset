  description: 'HOD was originally the communications unit AI of the Millennium,
    but was hacked by an unidentified AI, and now claims itself to be the 8th prophet
    of the Decagrammaton. It can be said that this is a runaway of the computing
    engine that contains the most advanced technology of the Millennium. If it is
    not stopped soon, the safety of the entire Millennium must be threatened.

    

    I
    will leave this to you and your students, Sensei.'
  chatStatus: From here on out. It's all up to you. Sensei.
