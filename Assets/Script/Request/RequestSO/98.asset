  description: 'There are several groups of gangsters and their leaders like Komakaze
    Rabu appear in the center of the city. It seems that they are planning something
    and we can''t let them stay like that. It would be a big problem for Kivotos
    if they gathered in one group.

    

    We need to break up their group before
    anything worse happens, Sensei.'
  chatStatus: From here on out. It's all up to you. Sensei.
