  detail: "\tA spacey girl who is a member of the Hyakkiyako Academy's Yin-Yang Club.\r\n\r\n\tExtremely
    fond of traditional activities such as writing haiku, which led her to join the
    Yin-Yang Club. Her exotic looks and presence have made her the envy of her peers
    at Hyakkiyako, but she seems completely oblivious to that fact."
