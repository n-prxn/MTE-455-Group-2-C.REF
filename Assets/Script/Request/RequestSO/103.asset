  description: '"Sensei, Sorry to interrupt your working time. I, Kirifuji Nagisa,
    the host of the next meeting of our Tea Party need advice from your opinion.


    I
    have heard that some people in the Tea Party plan to take over the leader position.
    I can''t figure out who or how they are going to do but I know that you can.


    I
    have the list of suspects with me, I will give it to you as soon as you meet
    me in person. Oh, you can bring a Trinity student that you trust along with you.
    I don''t mind either."'
