  detail: "\tChair of the Security Committee in charge of Red Winter Academy's safety.\r\n\r\n\tThough
    she's known as cold-hearted disciplinarian, the truth is she blindly follows
    President Cherino's orders without thinking. She likes the word \"charge\" and
    is the first to run off when a problem occurs within the Red Winter Academy,
    but often loses her way due to her terrible sense of direction."
