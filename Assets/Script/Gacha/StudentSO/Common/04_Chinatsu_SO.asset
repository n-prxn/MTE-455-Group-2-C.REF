  detail: "\tShe is in charge of medical aid at Gehenna Academy's Prefect Team.\r\n\r\n\tChinatsu
    is one of the few people with common sense among the obsessively dogmatic Prefect
    Team. She's usually the one who prevents other members like Ako and Iori from
    running amok. Her tone can be harsh and give the impression of being just as
    cold as any other member of the Prefect Team, but she is actually a sweet young
    girl who melts at the sight of cute animals."
