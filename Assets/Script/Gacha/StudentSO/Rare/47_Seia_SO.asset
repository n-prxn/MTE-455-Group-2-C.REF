  detail: "\tSeia is one of the three presidents of the Tea Party. Compared to the
    other two presidents, Seia has a distinctive way of speaking as her choice of
    vocabulary differs quite clearly from the others. Seia is also known to have
    prophetic dreams which can predict the future accurately most of the time. She
    can also talk to other people through these dreams.\r\n\r\n\tSeia is rather philosophical
    when she talks. This is possibly caused by her ability to see the future. Thanks
    to this ability of hers, she often chooses to not do anything about the dreams
    she sees as she believes that the future can't be changed."
