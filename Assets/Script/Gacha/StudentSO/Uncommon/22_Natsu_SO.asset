  detail: "\tA member of the Trinity After-School Sweets Club, head troublemaker,
    and a self-proclaimed romantic.\r\n\r\n\tHas a habit of being strangely philosophical
    and comparing everything to desserts, making people around her feel awkward.
    She claims she simply wants to share her romanticism with everyone. However,
    it's impossible to deny that Natsu may just be messing with everyone since her
    definition of \"romance\" is always changing."
