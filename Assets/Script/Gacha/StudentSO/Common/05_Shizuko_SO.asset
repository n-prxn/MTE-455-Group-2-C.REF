  detail: "\tPresident of the Festival Operations Department at Hyakkiyako Academy.\r\n\r\n\tThe
    mascot of Momoyodou, the Hyakkiyako's traditional tea house. Acts clumsy, but
    only because it sells her image as an idol. In truth, she's an expert flirt willing
    to do anything for the success of the festivals and Momoyodou. Wears her heart
    on her sleeve, making her an easy read for her friends as well as Sensei."
