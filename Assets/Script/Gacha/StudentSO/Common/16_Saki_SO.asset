  detail: "\tThe point woman of the SRT Academy RABBIT Squad. Call sign is \"RABBIT
    2.\"\r\n\r\n\tSaki enrolled in the SRT Academy to live the life of discipline
    she'd always dreamed of. When the academy closed down, she, along with her squad,
    refused to give up on their school and began camping out in the park in protest.
    A star student, she still carries around her textbooks and SRT manuals to this
    day. She enjoys foraging for wild greens and trash that can be repurposed as
    supplies."
