  detail: "\tHead prefect of the Gehenna Academy Prefect Team.\r\n\r\n\tSomewhat
    aloof and considers almost everything a bother and a chore, but is still every
    bit the head prefect of the Prefect Team when it comes to rules and regulations.
    Her general response to most things is \"Ugh, so annoying,\" but she's ruthless
    and decisive when it comes to matters on the battlefield.\r\nFeared and respected
    by the enemies of Gehenna."
