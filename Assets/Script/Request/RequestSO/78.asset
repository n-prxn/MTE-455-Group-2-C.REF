  description: 'Good Morning, Sensei. Have you seen Momoka around Schale? She just
    disappears from her working room.

    

    I think that she may take her
    slack-off somewhere nearby. Please, Sensei. If you find her, bring her back to
    me. We still have a lot of work to deal with. '
  chatStatus: From here on out. it's all up to you. Sensei.
