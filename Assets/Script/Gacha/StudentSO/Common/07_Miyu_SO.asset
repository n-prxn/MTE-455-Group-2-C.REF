  detail: "\tThe sniper of the SRT Academy RABBIT Squad. Her call sign is \"RABBIT
    4.\"\r\n\r\n\tMiyu entered the SRT Academy due to her natural sniping talent,
    but struggled with her meek and shy temperament. Just as she found a home in
    the academy, it closed down and she joined the rest of her squad camping out
    in the park. Her lack of presence makes her a great sniper, but sometimes even
    her allies forget she exists."
