  detail: "\tRio is the student council president of Millennium. Cold and calculating,
    she cares more about objective facts than emotions. She is at odds with Himari
    due to their contrasting personalities.\r\n\r\n\tRio has always been unsociable
    and rather scrupulous. She never lets emotions change her mind and always sticks
    to the facts. Because of this, a lot of students find Rio to be terrifying, but
    Rio doesn't let their opinions into her head. Rio is also very determined when
    it comes to reaching her goals, even breaking the rules if she has to."
