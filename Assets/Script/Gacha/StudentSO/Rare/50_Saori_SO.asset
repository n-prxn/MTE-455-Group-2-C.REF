  detail: "\tThe leader of the Arius Squad, an elite special forces unit within the
    Arius Academy.\r\n\r\n\tShe has a cold side where she uses any means or methods
    necessary to achieve her goal, but she is passionate and she expresses her emotions
    honestly. She's an unrivaled expert when it comes to guerrilla tactics, but she
    lacks common sense in everyday life. It's said that the Arius Squad's combat
    power is the result of completing Saori's training from start to finish."
