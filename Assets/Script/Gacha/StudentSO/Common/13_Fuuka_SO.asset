  detail: "\tA member of the School Lunch Club that manages the Gehenna Academy's
    dining hall.\r\n\r\n\tA kind and earnest student, making her a bit of a rarity
    at Gehenna. She prepares and serves hundreds of meals every morning for the students
    of Gehenna. She's a good cook, but her skills are written off due to the dining
    hall's lack of manpower. Still, she refuses to give up and is constantly looking
    for ways to improve the menu."
