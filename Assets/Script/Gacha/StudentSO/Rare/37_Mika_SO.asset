  detail: "\tThe former leader of Pater, one of the allied factions that makes up
    Trinity General School.\r\n\r\n\tA former Tea Party member and a childhood friend
    of Nagisa, another member of the Tea Party. When the two clash politically, she
    draws a clear line between their public disagreements and their private friendship.\r\nShe
    seems lively and cheerful, and she's never without a smile. However, her demeanor
    hides worries that she can't reveal, making her something of an enigma."
