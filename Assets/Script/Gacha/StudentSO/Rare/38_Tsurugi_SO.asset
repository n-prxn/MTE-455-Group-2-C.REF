  detail: "\tPresident of Trinity's Justice Task Force and its official strategic
    weapon.\r\n\r\n\tShe is belligerent and violent, with a tendency to destroy anything
    she doesn't like. However, thanks to the painstaking efforts of the task force's
    vice president, Hasumi, the club has managed to hold itself together. Tsurugi
    is like a beast that can't be controlled, but even she can't help but soften
    up when she's with her Sensei."
