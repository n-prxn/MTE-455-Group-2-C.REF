  description: 'Abi-Eshuh is strong and impressive though, it needs to be maintained
    like the usual devices.

    

    Thanks that Himari can figure out a way
    to maintain it better, but she said that she can''t do it by herself alone. Lending
    some hands would be helpful and make the work quicker.

    

    I want you
    to help me, Sensei. In return, I will help you with anything you want.'
  chatStatus: I can make tea. I'm used to it.
