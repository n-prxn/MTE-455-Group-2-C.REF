  detail: "\tA member of Trinity's Make-Up Work Club.\r\n\r\n\tKoharu was originally
    part of the Justice Task Force, but she was forced to transfer to the Make-Up
    Work Club due to poor grades which put her at risk of flunking. A dunce who can't
    keep up with her classes despite thinking she's an elite student. Koharu reads
    racy material for fun, and gets dirty ideas from the most trivial things, which
    ends with her embarrassing herself."
