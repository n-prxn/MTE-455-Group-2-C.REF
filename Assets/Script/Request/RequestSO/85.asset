  description: 'A long time ago, a mysterious phenomenon was reported in the amusement
    park "Slumpia", which was closed due to financial difficulties. It is rumored
    that the stopped lotus dolls and various attractions will start moving again
    at midnight and attack people.

    

    I will leave this to you and your
    students, Sensei.'
  chatStatus: From here on out. It's all up to you. Sensei.
