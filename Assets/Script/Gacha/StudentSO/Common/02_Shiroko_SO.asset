  detail: 'Enrolled in Abydos High School, Shiroko is the sports-loving field captain
    of the Countermeasure Council.



    Generally a girl of few words and few emotions,
    she gives off an aloof aura but holds the interest of Abydos above all else.
    In order to revitalize the school, she is willing to do anything, and occasionally
    comes up with ridiculous plans.'
