  description: 'Binah is the No.3 Prophet of the Decagrammaton has been spotted in
    Abydos. No-one knows why this cyber monstrosity appeared here, but it''s definitely
    too dangerous to leave it alone. It''s been also reported that the "Purifying
    Storm" skill he begins to use halfway through the battle is very powerful, so
    please be careful when leading the battle!

    

    I will leave this to
    you and your students, Sensei.'
  chatStatus: From here on out. It's all up to you. Sensei.
