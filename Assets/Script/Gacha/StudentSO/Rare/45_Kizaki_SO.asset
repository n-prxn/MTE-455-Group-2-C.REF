  detail: "\tKisaki is the head of the Xuanlong Office and the student council president
    of Shanhaijing. She is called the Master by the students of the school.\r\n\r\n\tAs
    the Master of Xuanlong, she is capable of planning far ahead with proper judgement.
    Despite the fanaticism present within Xuanlong, Kisaki herself is a calm and
    reasonable individual who highly values the truth, rather than conceptions made
    by others. That said, she also has a mildly playful side in her, though it rarely
    surfaces."
