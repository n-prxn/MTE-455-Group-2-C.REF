  detail: "\tPresident of the Gehenna Gourmet Research Society.\r\n\r\n\tAt a glance,
    she appears to possess the graceful charisma of a refined lady. But when it comes
    to food, she can turn into a deranged maniac at the flip of a switch. Despite
    her uncontrollable gluttony, she actually can't stomach too much food at once.
    Her favorite foods are those rich in fat, such as motsunabe and horumonyaki."
