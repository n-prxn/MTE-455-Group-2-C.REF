  detail: "\tA member of the Pandemonium Society.\r\n\r\n\tThere's nothing Iroha
    hates more than being bothered. She spends much of her time trying to figure
    out how to escape company. She even constantly carries a book around so people
    will leave her alone, but the Pandemonium Society (Makoto, to be exact) always
    interrupts her anyway. She begrudgingly serves as an executive of the Pandemonium
    Society, only finding comfort in their mascot, Ibuki."
